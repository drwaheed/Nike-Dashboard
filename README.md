-- 2. Average Ambulance Car Per Day
Avg Ambulance Car Per Day =
AVERAGEX(VALUES(CMT[Call Receive]), CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(CMT[Ambulance Plate])))

-- 3. Monthly Average Ambulance Car
Monthly Avg Ambulance Car =
AVERAGEX(
    VALUES(DATE(YEAR(CMT[Call Receive]), MONTH(CMT[Call Receive]), 1)),
    CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(CMT[Ambulance Plate]))
)

-- 4. Daily Average Orders per Ambulance Car
Daily Avg Orders Per Car =
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(CMT)), CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(CMT[Ambulance Plate])))

-- 5. Monthly Avg Orders per Ambulance Car
Monthly Avg Orders Per Car =
AVERAGEX(
    VALUES(DATE(YEAR(CMT[Call Receive]), MONTH(CMT[Call Receive]), 1)),
    DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(CMT)), CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(CMT[Ambulance Plate])))
)

-- 6. Monthly Avg Distance per Ambulance Car
Monthly Avg Distance Per Car =
AVERAGEX(
    VALUES(DATE(YEAR(CMT[Call Receive]), MONTH(CMT[Call Receive]), 1)),
    DIVIDE(SUM(CMT[Distance]), CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(CMT[Ambulance Plate])))
)

-- 7. Daily Avg Distance per Ambulance Car
Daily Avg Distance Per Car =
AVERAGEX(
    VALUES(CMT[Call Receive]),
